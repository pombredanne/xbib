/**
 * An object for iterating over structured data streams with information
 * separators.
 *
 * The information separators of the C0 control group are defined in:
 * - ANSI X3.4-1967 (ASCII)
 * - IETF RFC 20 (Vint Cerf, 1969)
 * - ISO-646:1972 
 * - ECMA-6 3rd revision August 1973
 * - ECMA-48
 * - ISO/IEC 6429
 * - CCITT International Telegraph Alphabet Number 5 (ITA-5)
 *
 * From ASCII-1967:
 * "Can be used as delimiters to mark fields of data structures.
 * If used for hierarchical levels, US is the lowest level (dividing
 * plain-text data items), while RS, GS, and FS are of increasing level
 * to divide groups made up of items of the level beneath it."
 *
 *  Form IETF RFC 20:
 * "Information Separator: A character which is used to separate
 *  and qualify information in a logical sense.  There is a group of four
 *  such characters, which are to be used in a hierarchical order."
 *
 * From ECMA-48 (ISO/IEC 6429):
 *
 * "Each information separator is given two names. The names,
 * INFORMATION SEPARATOR FOUR (IS4), INFORMATION SEPARATOR THREE (IS3),
 * INFORMATION SEPARATOR TWO (IS2), and INFORMATION SEPARATOR ONE (IS1)
 * are the general names. The names FILE SEPARATOR (FS), GROUP SEPARATOR (GS),
 * RECORD SEPARATOR (RS), and UNIT SEPARATOR (US) are the specific names and
 * are intended mainly for applications where the information separators are
 * used hierarchically. The ascending order is then US, RS, GS, FS.
 * In this case, data normally delimited by a particular separator cannot
 * be split by a higher-order separator but will be considered as delimited by
 * any other higher-order separator.
 * In ISO/IEC 10538, IS3 and IS4 are given the names PAGE TERMINATOR (PT)
 * and DOCUMENT TERMINATOR (DT), respectively and may be used to reset
 * presentation attributes to the default state."
